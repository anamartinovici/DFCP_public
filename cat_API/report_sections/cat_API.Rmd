# Info about the Cat API

Go to <https://developers.thecatapi.com> to read more about this API, how to get access, and what type of information you can collect. For example: you need an API Key to collect more than 10 images. Getting an API key is relatively easy, see: <https://thecatapi.com/> for info about what is available with the free access plan.

## How to collect data

The file `cat_API/one_cat.R` shows the hello world equivalent of collecting data from the API.

These lines of code place the request:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
file_name <- here::here("cat_API", "one_cat.R")
start_line <- 1
end_line <- 17
knitr::read_chunk(path = file_name, labels = "my-query-params", from = start_line, to = end_line) 

```

```{r, my-query-params, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```

### Data example

This is the photo collected with the example code:

```{r, class.source = 'fold-hide'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here::here("cat_API", "photos", "one_cat.jpg"),
                        rel_path = FALSE)
```

## Data collection

After checking that the simple example worked, I've extended the code to allow for collection of multiple observations and fields. Data collection took place in `cat_API/collect_data.R`. Multiple requests were placed with a filter on retrieving observations that have breed information.

The raw data collected from the API was saved within the repo and then processed by a separate script.
