## Tips and tricks

1. Knit directory

Check `Tools` -> `Global Options` -> `R Markdown` -> evaluate code chunks in directory. Do the same for `Tools` -> `Project Options`.

**Recommendation**: use `Document`!

2. `YAML`

Check the `YAML` section in this file. You'll notice that I'm using `bookdown`. For more details: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/

Try to see what happens if you switch between `true` and `false` some of the output specifications. For example, try it out with `number_sections`. Then, see what happens when the child document has a different value for `number_section` compared to the main report.
